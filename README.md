# greengraph
_____________

greengraph uses satellite imagery to compute the proportion of 'green' pixels between two locations. This may be useful for assessing levels of urbanisation, for example.

Once installed, greengraph can be invoked from the command line using, for example:

  > greengraph --begin "London" --end "Paris" --steps 20 --out graph.png
  
This will save the output as a 'graph.png' in the current working directory.
  
# Installation

To install this software, please enter the command "sudo pip install git+git://github.com/jscott6/greengraph" at the command line.
