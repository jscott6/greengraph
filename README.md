# greengraph
_____________

This is the 'greengraph' coursework for the course Research Software Engineering with Python.

greengraph uses satellite imagery to compute the proportion of 'green' pixels between two locations. This may be useful for assessing levels of urbanisation. 

greengraph can be invoked from the command line using, for example:

  > greengraph --begin "London" --end "Paris" --steps 20 --out graph.png
